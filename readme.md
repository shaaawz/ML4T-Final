## 02-07 Dealing with Data
- [ ] Aggregated  - how data is combined and reported
- [ ] Tick- a successful buy/sell transaction at different exchanged (prices and volumes are different)
- [ ] Data can be represented as open, high, low, close and volume within a time period (daily data)
- [ ] Open - first transaction within the time period
- [ ] High - Highest price in the time period
- [ ] Low - Lowest price in the time Period
- [ ] Close = Last transaction within the time period
- [ ] Volume - Total volume in that time period
- [ ] Stock Split may be the reason why prices may drop suddenly
- [ ] Reason fo Stock Splits:
  -  Prices too high - cannot buy too many stocks at once and stock becomes less liquid
  -  Portfolio Evaluation because hard to finely tune when stock prices are too high
-  [ ] Solution for accounting for Split - Adjusted Close
-  [ ] Last day stays the same price, and previous "higher" (prices due to splits) - are divided by the ratio to accurately account for increase in value
-  [ ] Dividends - paid out to owners
-  [ ] Significant effect on what happens to stock
-  [ ] Day Before Dividend is paid: value of the stock goes up to match that of the divident pay out
-  [ ] Day of Dividend paid - price goes back to valuation without dividend amount
-  [ ] Adjusted Price for Dividends: We adjust prices down as we go back in history by the dividend amount
-  [ ] Last day of file: The actual close and adjusted close are the exact same, back in time, the prices will diverge
-  [ ] Survivor Bias - Start with today's universe stock: SP500 and apply algo to choose stocks to buy based on that price in the past
-  [ ] Mistake to look at membership of universe stock TODAY and use those specific stocks to create a strategy in historic data - because the SP500 in that past date - Must use Survivor Bias Free Data
